This chapter tasks you with exploring an old toy factory where there lives a large toy monster. To complete this chapter you need to make your way through the entrance and assembly areas of the factory while being chased by the monster. To help you complete this first chapter we’ve put together the Poppy Playtime chapter 1 A Tight Squeeze guide below.  <img src=\"https:\/\/i1.sndcdn.com\/artworks-i5qrsElYqmjcSbA3-Dvcn7w-t500x500.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/> </div>",

Select New Game to start the first Chapter. This chapter has the following description:\\n\\n“As an ex-employee of Playtime co., you finally return to the factory many years after everybody within disappeared.”\\n\\nNext to this description is the monster that will be chasing you throughout the first chapter. If you follow this guide you can complete the chapter in about 30 minutes to an hour.  <img src=\"https:\/\/static2.srcdn.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Poppy-Playtime-Huggy-Wuggy-Greeting.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/></div>",

Once you have control walk forward to the front desk and grab the Green Tape from off of the desk using the interact button. Take the tape over to the tv and Green VCR to the right of the desk. Put the tape into the VCR and watch the video. <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.holdtoreset.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/20125342\/green-tape-location-poppy-playtime-750x422.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/></div>",

Inside the Gift Shop look at the ceiling for a train running on a suspended track. Make a note of the colors you see on the train. Leave the Gift Shop and head back through the reception area into Security. Here you will find a locked door with a colored keypad. Push the colors that were on the train to open the door. The solution is:\n\n    Green.\n    Pink.\n    Yellow.\n    Red. \n\nWhen you input the colors listed above you will unlock the door. Head through the door into the Security Office. Here we will get a few important items.  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.holdtoreset.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/20125508\/security-door-puzzle-solution-poppy-playtime-750x422.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/></div>",

Grab the Blue Tape by interacting with it and put it in the nearby Blue VCR. Watch the video on the tape. The tape introduces you to using the hands we will get. These hands are very important as they are used to solve most of the puzzles encountered during Chapter 1.\n\nWhen the video concludes the container holding the Blue hand will open. Approach the hand and interact with it to equip it on your character. You get a blue left hand to start with.  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.holdtoreset.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/20125649\/blue-tape-location-and-blue-hand-poppy-playtime-750x422.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/> </div>",

Jump over the turn-style by the front desk to reach a door with a blue hand above it. Shoot your blue hand at the switch to open the door. This door leads you to the factory and the real start of the scary section of the game.  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.holdtoreset.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/20125825\/blue-hand-door-poppy-playtime-750x422.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/></div>",

The first, and most prominent, is the large toy creature named Huggy Wuggy in the center of the room. Huggy Wuggy is the toy that chases you throughout this chapter. The second thing you will notice is that there are seven doors in this room. These doors lead to different areas of the factory.\n\nBefore going through any of the doors we need to grab the Yellow Power Room Key dangling from the giant toys hand using your blue hand. To do this shoot the blue hand door to the left. The door won’t open because it has no power. When you do this the Yellow Key will drop into the creatures upraised hand. Use your hand to grab it.  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.holdtoreset.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/20130410\/key-lobby-poppy-playground-750x422.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/> </div>",

Use the Blue hand to open this cover on the socket. Once the socket is open shoot the Blue hand onto the exposed socket. Hold the Blue hand there and walk around the two electricity conducting poles in the room leading back to the front. Doing this correctly turns the power back on.\n\nWith the power back on head back to the lobby area. You will notice that Huggy Wuggy is gone. From this point on you will encounter this monster as you explore the other rooms of the building. Are next stop is through the Blue hand door we tried opening without there being power. Open it now and head through it. Go down the hallway and go through the door on your left. Walk down the dark hallway into the next area. <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.holdtoreset.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/20131348\/turn-power-back-on-poppy-playtime-750x422.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/></div>",

The first place you can go is the Pet Dump, which is located next to the Garage. In one of the storage boxes, you can find a lot of New Year\u2019s things. Open several boxes to collect all the items in the Junkyard. Here you can put together a complete herringbone costume and come up with an interesting story with it. One of the boxes will contain antlers and a hat with a Santa Claus pompom. In addition to costumes, you can also find Christmas decorations and toys at the Garbage. We advise you to explore all the boxes to find more holiday items.\r\n\r\nMail. The next building in Bob City where you should go for New Year\u2019s items is the Post Office. Going deeper into the hall, you can see vertical shelves - this is a storage (archive) of forgotten things. We advise you to flip the shelves up until the holiday items appear. Keep in mind that items can be on multiple shelves, so flip through them all. Basically, in the post office you can get a variety of fireworks and Christmas-themed toys.\r\n\r\nFarm. For even more New Year\u2019s items, head to the Farm location to the store with a horse\u2019s head flaunting above. All over the shop you will find various items, you can find among them Christmas gifts, interesting decorations and toys. The picture above shows the location in the shop where you can find gifts and boxes with holiday items.<img src=\"https:\/\/wisegeek.ru\/kartinki\/aac\/1301-1600\/1306-18.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",
