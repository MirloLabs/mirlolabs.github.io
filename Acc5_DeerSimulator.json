Let\u2019s check it out.\r\nThe Operation\r\nif you destroy a flat car (until you only have the frame) and flip it upside down, your camera gous under the map, if you are in 1st person. use this to look under the train tracks by the front gate, and you will see a loot crate, if you use the jeep in the shed the same way (make sure it gets placed perfectly) but it will let you go fully under the ground, make sure to save first, for this part is hard.\r\nif you make the landing and are standing on the crate, it has every weapon (plus a new one) in it, but it claims it is a pipe bomb. you can\u2019t pick it up. this fact makes me mad. sorry i could not get my screenshots into the guide, but you can check my profile for them. i don\u2019t have any mods. i don\u2019t know how to install them.<img src=\"https:\/\/oyster.ignimgs.com\/mediawiki\/apis.ign.com\/teardown\/6\/64\/Teardown_01_12_2020_16_16_11.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

Head towards the Lockelle building on the leftDrag and open the front gates, then remove the boxes from in front of the door. Head inside and you'll be able to pick up some tools. You'll get an extinguisher, spray can and a sledgehammer.\r\n\r\nOnce you pick up your tools, the instructions at the top of the screen will change and you'll be told that you need to replace a fuse to turn the power on. Head outside (towards the white marker) go through the door at the back of the room, and then through the one on the left. On the right, there's a small building. Some trees will be blocking the door. Use the sledgehammer to destroy the trees and go inside. Go to the end of the room and on the left, you can replace the fuse. Go back to the main building.\r\n\r\nNow you'll be able to access the computer and your emails. This will be where you start each mission and also check and upgrade your tools.<img src=\"https:\/\/oyster.ignimgs.com\/mediawiki\/apis.ign.com\/teardown\/d\/da\/Teardown_01_12_2020_16_11_55.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

But make sure you have a good look around all of the rooms to find some valuables and secrets. These can be spent on tool upgrades later.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you're told is that you can use TAB to open your map and see where each of the primary targets is. You'll also see your location and the what the conditions of the map are (so in this case, there are fire alarms). You'll want to consider the conditions for each level, so you can complete the mission without triggering security.\r\n\r\nHead towards the factory and open the front gate. The three computers you need to find are in: the office, the harbor office, and the factory. Leave the factory until last and collect the ones in the office and harbor office first.\r\n\r\nThere are propane tanks around this map which you can use to blow holes in walls. There are also vehicles you can make use of that will destroy buildings. Use the map to locate the first two computers in the office and harbor office \u2013 use whatever means you prefer to reach them. For the final computer, you'll need to head towards the factory. There is a green vehicle here you can use as a lift. Line this up so you can run up it and jump into the office.<img src=\"https:\/\/oyster.ignimgs.com\/mediawiki\/apis.ign.com\/teardown\/7\/77\/Teardown_01_12_2020_16_35_13.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

Grab the Blue Tape by interacting with it and put it in the nearby Blue VCR. Watch the video on the tape. The tape introduces you to using the hands we will get. These hands are very important as they are used to solve most of the puzzles encountered during Chapter 1.\n\nWhen the video concludes the container holding the Blue hand will open. Approach the hand and interact with it to equip it on your character. You get a blue left hand to start with.  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.holdtoreset.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/20125649\/blue-tape-location-and-blue-hand-poppy-playtime-750x422.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/> </div>",

Jump over the turn-style by the front desk to reach a door with a blue hand above it. Shoot your blue hand at the switch to open the door. This door leads you to the factory and the real start of the scary section of the game.  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.holdtoreset.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/20125825\/blue-hand-door-poppy-playtime-750x422.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/></div>",

The first, and most prominent, is the large toy creature named Huggy Wuggy in the center of the room. Huggy Wuggy is the toy that chases you throughout this chapter. The second thing you will notice is that there are seven doors in this room. These doors lead to different areas of the factory.\n\nBefore going through any of the doors we need to grab the Yellow Power Room Key dangling from the giant toys hand using your blue hand. To do this shoot the blue hand door to the left. The door won’t open because it has no power. When you do this the Yellow Key will drop into the creatures upraised hand. Use your hand to grab it.  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.holdtoreset.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/20130410\/key-lobby-poppy-playground-750x422.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/> </div>",

Use the Blue hand to open this cover on the socket. Once the socket is open shoot the Blue hand onto the exposed socket. Hold the Blue hand there and walk around the two electricity conducting poles in the room leading back to the front. Doing this correctly turns the power back on.\n\nWith the power back on head back to the lobby area. You will notice that Huggy Wuggy is gone. From this point on you will encounter this monster as you explore the other rooms of the building. Are next stop is through the Blue hand door we tried opening without there being power. Open it now and head through it. Go down the hallway and go through the door on your left. Walk down the dark hallway into the next area. <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.holdtoreset.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/20131348\/turn-power-back-on-poppy-playtime-750x422.jpg\"  alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/></div>",

The first place you can go is the Pet Dump, which is located next to the Garage. In one of the storage boxes, you can find a lot of New Year\u2019s things. Open several boxes to collect all the items in the Junkyard. Here you can put together a complete herringbone costume and come up with an interesting story with it. One of the boxes will contain antlers and a hat with a Santa Claus pompom. In addition to costumes, you can also find Christmas decorations and toys at the Garbage. We advise you to explore all the boxes to find more holiday items.\r\n\r\nMail. The next building in Bob City where you should go for New Year\u2019s items is the Post Office. Going deeper into the hall, you can see vertical shelves - this is a storage (archive) of forgotten things. We advise you to flip the shelves up until the holiday items appear. Keep in mind that items can be on multiple shelves, so flip through them all. Basically, in the post office you can get a variety of fireworks and Christmas-themed toys.\r\n\r\nFarm. For even more New Year\u2019s items, head to the Farm location to the store with a horse\u2019s head flaunting above. All over the shop you will find various items, you can find among them Christmas gifts, interesting decorations and toys. The picture above shows the location in the shop where you can find gifts and boxes with holiday items.<img src=\"https:\/\/wisegeek.ru\/kartinki\/aac\/1301-1600\/1306-18.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

We\u2019ll give you some tips on where to find your pets.\r\n\r\nThe search is done by the standard hero Nari:\r\n\r\n    Take Nari to the warehouse and give her a slice of pizza (available at the Mall) and a rose (found at the barber shop) to get Midge\u2019s pet.\r\n    Then take Nari to the Vault and give her the Poop figurine (found in the Apartment) and toilet paper (found in the Mall in the main world) to get the Poop pet.\r\n    Take Nari to the Vault and give her the Green Band magazine and baguette to get the pet with the pencil.\r\n    You will also receive the animal with the help of a photo of a lady with glasses from the Quarter and a \"bigger flower\" from the mail.\r\n    The purple octopus and the \"taller mail flower\" will give you another creature.\r\n.<img src=\"https:\/\/wisegeek.ru\/kartinki\/aac\/1301-1600\/1306-21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",
