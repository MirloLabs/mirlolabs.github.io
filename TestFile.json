This is an imagination of what happens if you got transported into the middle of a rural Finnish countryside. Surrounded by a completely wacky world that can humor you as much as it can kill, you\u2019re then tasked with building a car. Though for an experience this silly, the car building part of the game is surprisingly meticulous and detailed. That will the premise of our My Summer Car guide; how to actually put the car together.<img src=\"https:\/\/steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net\/ugc\/940559377261822158\/1D65454AD266D9D2F4F87F2169C45C17EDF7417C\/\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

Before heading straight for the garage and getting greasy, there are a few things you should probably do first. First of all, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that MSC has a permadeath mechanic in place, thus doubling this to become a survival game. It means that you need to take care of your in-game player. They too have basic requirements such as having to eat, drink, and get some sleep. For our My Summer Car guide, it won\u2019t be enough to just build the Satsuma and ignore this.\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/lmn\/image\/upload\/c_limit,h_360,w_640\/e_sharpen:100\/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto\/v1\/gameskinnyc\/3\/8\/5\/38581f85b6564fc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

    "slide_content_2" : "<div style=\"-moz-user-select: none;-webkit-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none;-o-user-select: none;user-select: none;\">The first thing you need to do is jack the car up so you can work on the frame and underpinnings of the vehicle. To raise the body:\r\n\r\n    Place the floor jack under the front bumper of the car. \r\n    Use the lever to raise the floor jack (and the car) to its limit.\r\n\r\nOnce you've got the car jacked up, head over to the tool box. To use the tool box, hover your cursor to its opening and press \"Use\". You'll need to come back here often to switch out tools as necessary. To get to a specific tool, press 2, then click on whichever one you need. Once you have it, press 1 to hide that tool.<img src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/lmn\/image\/upload\/e_sharpen:100\/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto\/v1\/gameskinnyc\/4\/b\/f\/4bf354d1915454083cb3c4ee7c7b5c453a20dc5319f4e314a981250e1d62-60b3e.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

So you'll want to lower your frame and remove the floor jack. Move it to the rear bumper of the car, then jack the vehicle back up.\r\n\r\nOnce it's up, you'll need to add more parts in the following order:\r\n\r\n    Trail Arms, Coil Springs, Shock Absorbers, Drum Brakes, Rear Wheels\r\n        Attach rear left (RL) and rear right (RR) trail arms with 12mm screws (x2 each)\r\n        Attach two coil strings (no screws needed)\r\n        Attach two shock absorbers with 12mm screws (x1 each) on top, and 6mm screws (x2 each) on the bottom.\r\n        Attach two drum brakes with 14mm screws (x1 each)\r\n        Attach RL and RR wheel steel with 13mm screws (x4 each)\r\n.<img src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/lmn\/image\/upload\/c_limit,h_360,w_640\/e_sharpen:100\/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto\/v1\/gameskinnyc\/8\/1\/4\/814389237-preview-080-1a6bf.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

Push your car into the garage where you'll complete the next several steps. \r\n\r\nFor right now, though, you're going to set the car aside and focus on building your engine. Set the engine block on a spacious work table and build it out as follows:\r\n\r\n    Block, Crankshaft, Main Bearings, Pistons\r\n        Put the engine block on a table\r\n        Attach the crankshaft (no screws needed)\r\n        Attach main bearings 1, 2 and 3 with 9mm screws (x2 each)\r\n        Attach pistons 1, 2, 3, and 4 with size 7 nuts (x2 each)\r\n    Head Gasket, Cylinder Head, Headers, Motor Hoist\r\n        Attach the head gasket (no screws needed)\r\n        Attach the cylinder head with 7mm screws (x10)\r\n        Attach the headers with 8mm screws (x5)\r\n        Place the motor hoist on top of the engine\r\n        Fasten the engine to the motor hoist with 10mm screws (x2)\r\n            As you tighten each screw, the engine will align into the correct position.\r\n.<img src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/lmn\/image\/upload\/c_limit,h_360,w_640\/e_sharpen:100\/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto\/v1\/gameskinnyc\/m\/a\/x\/maxresdefault-d5b88.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

At the same time, food can be packaged behind each counter. Each place where packaging takes place is marked with a flag with a drawn container. But only the product that is prepared for the given shop will be packaged.

In order to start the search for Rita\u2019s items, you need to give the girl a yellow joystick (it is in her apartment), and then move Rita to the lower panel of heroes. After you leave the heroine\u2019s apartment, you will need to take one more thing. The item is in the theater in the dressing room, backstage. You need to take a green gem. It lies in a box on a table by the mirror in the lower left corner. Before taking the stone, you need to remove Rita from the hero panel, and only after that give the girl a gem in her hand. After placing the stone in your hand, move Rita back to the panel\r\nPillow. After that, you can go to the HUS store. Going to the store, you need to get Rita from the hero panel.
