Then break the glass to switch open the next-door prior to pulling the beams from underneath the platform until it becomes a ramp.\r\n\r\nKeep the door open using one of the beams and move to the next room.

Open the door and drag the cart to the planks.\r\n\r\nNow move to the segment with the hook and use it to get to the other side. Use the same hook to pull down the plank which will create a ramp. Now go to the top and climb the wall.\r\n\r\nNow move across the bridge before you swing using a lantern. Now use the windmill to go to the next island. Then go to the top and uncover the hole.\r\n\r\nWhen you fall down the hole, climb up the rocks and push the boulder down to knock a ledge for you to climb up.

Easily one of the most action-packed Rec Room quests. Stay back and snipe the enemies with your bow or go up close and personal with a boom with the explosive stick. My favorite combination is the shield and crossbow. Protect yourself from any potential bombs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the level is the most interesting thing I have seen in VR. All the trolls have grenade launchers and dance around the fire trying to murder you. It\u2019s super fun. I wish Rec room would implement a better movement system for high action paced moments.<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/0*qugG4U5YLAoNICzk.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

You hop into a futuristic looking lobby with 3 other players filled with pistols, assault rifles, snipers, and shotguns. Once your team is ready you are immediately plunged into a world with angry laser shooting bots.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend starting off with a machine gun as you can position yourself in the back and give your team back up from the bots. My favorite feature of this gun is the sight that you can use to grab the other end with your other hand and aim down the sight.\r\n\r\nOn my most eventful quests, I matched in a lobby with 3 other charismatic adventurers. We made it through 9 levels and developed a high-five clapping virtual reality pact for life. Overall, I highly recommend playing this quest. Play it strategically and help your rec mates!<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/0*3xWD67y-aYH0miqi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

Bow and arrow are highly recommended due to flying bots that shoot exploding fireballs. Duck, kneel and dodge fireballs.\r\n\r\nI had an extremely intense moment in VR where the flying creatures surrounded me and I had a shield and dodged all of the fireballs while jumping and ducking. I bashed one of the flying creatures with my shield but then it got up and killed me.\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1200\/0*HVf5xRsyBNDsHlpB.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",
