Now use it to break the glass and get out. Now move through the debris and use the wrecking ball for going to the other side.

Now move inside and push the cart with the stone block to the stairs.\r\n\r\nClimb up and hop on to take the stone with you. Get to the top of the roof and then use the lanterns to get to the other side. Open the door and drag the cart to the planks.\r\n\r\nNow move to the segment with the hook and use it to get to the other side. Use the same hook to pull down the plank which will create a ramp. Now go to the top and climb the wall.\r\n\r\nNow move across the bridge before you swing using a lantern. Now use the windmill to go to the next island. Then go to the top and uncover the hole.\r\n\r\nWhen you fall down the hole, climb up the rocks and push the boulder down to knock a ledge for you to climb up. The platform on to the next area and catapult yourself to the bridge.<img src=\"https:\/\/img.xboxachievements.com\/images\/achievements\/3093\/132018-hi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",
