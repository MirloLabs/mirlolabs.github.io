On the loading screen, where the settings are located, and the \"Play\" button, there is a button in the form of a shopping cart, colored green. This is Toki\u2019s shop. After entering it, you should scroll through all the shopping offers to the very bottom, until you see a button that says: \"Restore all purchases.\" You should click on it. After that, the progress of the operation with the inscription: \"Wait\" will appear on the screen. After a few seconds, \"Excellent! Everything is ready!\" After that, you need to go into the game and check if this trick worked for you. All paid locations and buildings should appear in your Toki world.<img src=\"https:\/\/games.lol\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Toca-Life-World-Matchplay..jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

There are places for cooking in the Apartment, in (your) designer houses (if you want to put a hob and oven). All ingredients can be found in locations and secret places (we wrote about some below). Sometimes you can go into any available building and see if you can profit from something. Do not hesitate to borrow food from your neighbors, they will come in handy for a variety of game moments and fictional stories. It should be noted that cooking is not overshadowed by the presence of additional appliances (ovens, dishes, and so on). You just need to take the right ingredients and combine them in your character\u2019s hand. And to set the table beautifully, there are various culinary decorations and special dishes.<img src=\"https:\/\/img.utdstc.com\/screen\/c55\/544\/c555443514882bbdc5634d408c5c40befe66bf55db06997b04dfe3262cbf9571:800\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

It is an abandoned park, in the center of which there is an old castle. At the park gate, a detective is sitting on a bench with a few clues in his briefcase. One picture shows a statue of a lion with a button on it. Once inside the castle, you can see this statue at the elevator. Lower the lion\u2019s head to reveal a secret niche in the wall. In the niche, you should take a picture, and also get a scroll from the box - this is a hint for you. On the ground floor there is another painting in green tones (hanging on the wall to the right of the elevator). Put the clue, the picture from the safe and the green picture in the elevator.\r\n\r\nOn the second floor, to the right of the elevator, there are 5 candles on the wall, under which 5 paintings should be hung. The format of the images should match the footprint of the painting on the wall. The oval painting is in a chest under the window on the 2nd floor. There is a second clue in the same chest. Take it, and place the picture in the right place on the wall. A vertical rectangular canvas with a cast stands near a gramophone. Raise it and other artwork into place (as shown in the picture above).<img src=\"https:\/\/wisegeek.ru\/kartinki\/aac\/1301-1600\/1306-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

Easily one of the most action-packed Rec Room quests. Stay back and snipe the enemies with your bow or go up close and personal with a boom with the explosive stick. My favorite combination is the shield and crossbow. Protect yourself from any potential bombs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the level is the most interesting thing I have seen in VR. All the trolls have grenade launchers and dance around the fire trying to murder you. It\u2019s super fun. I wish Rec room would implement a better movement system for high action paced moments.<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/0*qugG4U5YLAoNICzk.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

You hop into a futuristic looking lobby with 3 other players filled with pistols, assault rifles, snipers, and shotguns. Once your team is ready you are immediately plunged into a world with angry laser shooting bots.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend starting off with a machine gun as you can position yourself in the back and give your team back up from the bots. My favorite feature of this gun is the sight that you can use to grab the other end with your other hand and aim down the sight.\r\n\r\nOn my most eventful quests, I matched in a lobby with 3 other charismatic adventurers. We made it through 9 levels and developed a high-five clapping virtual reality pact for life. Overall, I highly recommend playing this quest. Play it strategically and help your rec mates!<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/0*3xWD67y-aYH0miqi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

Bow and arrow are highly recommended due to flying bots that shoot exploding fireballs. Duck, kneel and dodge fireballs.\r\n\r\nI had an extremely intense moment in VR where the flying creatures surrounded me and I had a shield and dodged all of the fireballs while jumping and ducking. I bashed one of the flying creatures with my shield but then it got up and killed me.\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1200\/0*HVf5xRsyBNDsHlpB.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",
