If there are any inaccuracies\/mistakes in this guide, please comment and I will correct them.To make a ragdoll hold a weapon, such as a gun or knife, spawn one in and freeze the game by pressing spacebar, or whatever you have bound to pausing. Then, drag the weapon near the ragdoll\u2019s ,You may now unpause time. If the weapon is too heavy, or is interacting badly with the ragdoll, you may right click on it and disable collision or remove weight.\r\n\r\nWithout the use of mods, the ragdoll can not shoot other ragdolls on its own. You have to manually activate the weapon. To make the ragdoll drop the weapon, activate the hand holding the weapon. Alternatively, you can just kill the ragdoll.<img src=\"https:\/\/playgame.tips\/upload\/cache\/upload\/imgs\/peopleplaygroundpeopleplaygroundrusandeng-tips-s650x366.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",
